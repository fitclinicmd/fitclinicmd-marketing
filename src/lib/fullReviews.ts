// FULL REVIEWS — generated from the approved FitClinicMD long-form documents.
// Re-run the generator against the source PDFs rather than hand-editing, so the
// site and the approved copy cannot drift apart.
//
// WHY THESE ARE PAGES AND NOT JUST PDFs. The PDFs are still shipped and linked
// as a download, but they were the ONLY home for roughly 43,000 words — the
// deepest content on the site — and a PDF is absent from the sitemap, carries no
// schema, reads badly on a phone, and cannot be read properly by a screen
// reader. The whole llms.txt and structured-data effort was routing around them.
//
// USAGE LANGUAGE, NOT EVIDENCE LANGUAGE (Michael, 2026-08-31). Where a page
// described what animal or laboratory research showed, it now says what people
// USE the compound for and that it is not tested in people — \"Some have used it
// for this. Not tested in people.\" Describing usage removes the need to cite
// animal work at all, and is more honest than asserting an effect.
//
// ONE DELIBERATE EXEMPTION: the "Who it is not for" sections keep their animal
// references, because there the animal finding IS the reason for the
// contraindication — PT-141's fetal harm, Semax's abuse-potential signal.
// Stripping those would delete a safety rationale while leaving the exclusion
// unexplained, which is the opposite of protective.
//
// EVIDENCE LABELS REMOVED. The source documents carry an EVIDENCE column with
// tier words (\"Animal data only\", \"Theoretical\", \"Human trials\"). Those were
// removed from the short pages on 2026-08-25, so a reader was getting a clean
// short page and then landing on the exact language one click later. The column
// and the tier words are stripped here; the explanatory prose is kept, per
// Michael 2026-08-31. The generator asserts no EVIDENCE column survives.

Together they’re meant to produce a release pattern closer to what the body does naturally than either one alone. Clinical detail: CJC-1295 is a GHRH analog that establishes sustained GHRH-receptor signaling at the pituitary. Ipamorelin is a selective ghrelin-receptor (GHS-R) agonist that delivers a cortisol-and prolactin-neutral GH pulse. Because the two act on different receptors in the same pathway, their combined effect is proposed to be synergistic — GHRH signaling amplifying the pituitary’s responsiveness to the GHRP pulse — producing a more pronounced and more naturally patterned GH release than either compound alone." },

Clinical detail: Semax inhibits enkephalin breakdown and enhances dopamine and serotonin transmission, while raising BDNF, nerve growth factor, and VEGF to support neuroplasticity and cerebral blood flow, without raising heart rate. Selank modulates the GABAergic system, enhancing natural GABA sensitivity and release for an anxiolytic effect without sedation, while also raising serotonin and dopamine turnover and BDNF expression.

Clinical detail: Oxytocin binds receptors across the brain and body, modulating dopamine and serotonin to enhance trust and calm, amplifying arousal, and lowering amygdala activity to blunt fear and anxiety — mechanisms centered on social-emotional bonding. PT-141 (bremelanotide) binds melanocortin receptors MC3R and MC4R in the hypothalamus, increasing dopamine release and engaging arousal and reward circuits centrally, rather than acting on vascular smooth muscle the way PDE5 inhibitors do.

KPV (the C-terminal tripeptide of alpha-MSH) inhibits NF-κB activation, the transcription factor driving inflammatory cytokine production, without broadly suppressing immune competence. LL-37 is a cathelicidin-derived peptide with a cationic, amphipathic structure that disrupts microbial membranes directly, while also recruiting immune cells and promoting wound re-epithelialization.

Weight-loss results reported in trials of people with type 2 diabetes have been smaller than in trials of people without diabetes, and some approvals — including a 2025 approval for a form of fatty liver disease — rest on an accelerated pathway using a biomarker endpoint, with confirmatory long-term outcome data still pending. None of this trial evidence transfers to compounded semaglutide, which by definition is not the specific product that was studied. Some other investigated uses have far thinner evidence, ranging from a single small trial to no dedicated trial at all, and a large randomized trial specifically testing semaglutide for slowing Alzheimer's disease did not meet its primary endpoint, despite improving certain disease-related biomarkers." },

Compounded tirzepatide is a separate question. The shortage was declared resolved in December 2024 and the enforcement-discretion window closed in early 2025, about two months earlier than semaglutide's. FDA has since issued warning letters to telehealth sellers. Ask whether it is the approved product or a compounded preparation. On this compound the answer changes what you are taking." },

A dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, structurally engineered with a fatty-acid chain that binds albumin and extends its activity to about a week, enabling once-weekly dosing. Clinical development involved more than 24,000 people across the trial programs supporting its approvals. The compounding enforcement-discretion window closed 18 February 2025 for 503A pharmacies and 19 March 2025 for 503B facilities, roughly two months earlier than semaglutide's corresponding deadlines. Carries three separate FDA approvals, each supported by its own independently reviewed trial data rather than one approval covering every use." },
