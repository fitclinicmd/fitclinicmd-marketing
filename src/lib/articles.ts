//
// COMPLIANCE: education is not a place to smuggle in efficacy claims. Articles
// describe mechanisms and process conservatively, never promise an outcome from
// a specific product, and always state that compounded medications are not

It's one of a small group of signals called incretins, and it does a few quiet but important jobs: it tells the pancreas to release insulin when your blood sugar is up, it dials back a competing hormone (glucagon) that raises blood sugar, it slows how quickly the stomach empties, and it reaches areas of the brain involved in appetite. GLP-1 medicines work by making that natural signal stronger and longer-lasting.",
